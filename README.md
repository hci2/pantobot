# PantoBot - EM3

We made a chatbot called Pantobot, who is able to answer simple questions for a specific topic or a domain, for example “Inform me about the energy sector!”.  Here it answers with the three most influential topics containing the respective links for these three topics. It is also possible to filter these results for a specific year, language, platform, region or a keyword of your choice. You can also ask for the relation between topics.

It was realized as a group project in the bachelor university of the lecture "PR PAE Praktikum Anwendungsentwicklung in der Medieninformatik". It is based on Android, Java and Google Dialogflow (ex. api.ai).

## Usage

To run our app, you can simply copy PantoBot.apk to your android device and install.
